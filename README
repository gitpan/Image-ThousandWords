DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to take as input the path to an image file, and
    a string of text, and return an HTML colored text, resembling the image
    made out of the string, repeated as necessary.

    Henning Møller-Nielsen wrote the original, Lee Goddard modified it
    slightly.

    Henning said,

            The inspiration I got from http://www4.telge.kth.se/~d99_kme/
            look at http://rto.dk/images/camel.html or http://rto.dk/images/llama.html for the first versions
            (and I look like this: http://rto.dk/images/henning.htm)

            Modified by Lee Goddard (lgoddard-at-cpan.org) 2003, and again 15 February 2004
            - I did send Henning the mod, but he didn't publish it; I lost it, rewrote it
            and didn't want to re-write it again

DEPENDENCIES
            Carp
            GD
            Image::Thumbnail
            HTML::Entities

FUNCTION html
    Returns a HTML formatted string, colored to resemble IMAGE. The string
    consists of the letters and characters from STRING.

    Accepts parameters as a hash, list or hash-reference:

    image_path
        Path to the file to convert. Must be openable by your version of GD.
        If you don't supply this, you must supply "thumb" as a GD image.

    thumb
        If you do not supply "image_path" (above), you must supply this as a
        loaded GD image.

    text
        Text to use in conversion of the "file". Default is
        "aPictureIsWorthAThousandWords", so you'd better supply your own.
        Note that whitesapce will be stripped.

    font_face
        String to use in the HTML, which will be quoted in "double-quotes".
        Defaults to 'Arial Black','Lucida Console','Courier New', Courier'.

    font_size
        Number of pixels for the size of the font used: default is 8.

    line_height
        Number of pixels for the height of a line of text. Default value is
        two pixels less than the "font_size".

    scanline_skip
        The number of scan-lines or rows to skip jump in each read of the
        image. The default is to read every line, which is a "scanline_skip"
        of 1 - not a very clear name, sorry. Check the relation of this to
        the "line_height" parameter, above.

BACKWARDS COMPARABILITY
    The original "ThousandWords" module's "giveme" method is still
    acceptable.

KNOWN BUGS
    None, from a perl perspective. From an image perspective things look
    different :-)

VERSION HISTORY
    A bit of an overkill, but hey - this is Fun!

    0.01 Not really a module, just a script 0.02 'ThousandWords.pm' came to
    life 0.03 Fixed an error so the first text in a black image wouldn't be
    white 0.04 Fixed an error so the first text in a black image wouldn't be
    larger than the rest and so spaces no longer would be used 0.05 Ah -
    added POD 0.06 Re-sizing of image and new access means added by Lee

    Future:

            ANSI colored text?
            Resizing of image? - done by lee (twice)
